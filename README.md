## A brief overview

This comprehensive dashboard analyses road crash data in Victoria from 2012 to 2024, examining key factors contributing to accidents, their geographic distribution, demographic patterns of involved parties, and temporal crash concentrations. 

## Data in a glance

This analysis integrates nine distinct datasets, each capturing different aspects of road incidents: comprehensive accident details, vehicle specifications, personal information of involved parties, event sequences, precise location data, weather conditions at the time of accidents, detailed crash configurations (sub DCA), intersection/node information, and road surface characteristics.


### Analysis Insights

Analysis of the temporal patterns in the accident data reveals the following key findings:

1. Monthly Variations:
- March had the highest number of total accidents (17,483) and injuries (22,323)
- June had the lowest number of total accidents (13,589) and injuries (17,405)
- November recorded the highest number of fatalities (284)

2. Daily and Hourly Patterns:
- Weekdays show consistent high-risk periods during:
  * Morning peak (8:00-9:00 AM)
  * Afternoon/evening peak (3:00-7:00 PM)
- Weekends display different patterns with:
  * Higher accident concentrations between 11:00 AM-3:00 PM
  * Generally lower early morning incidents

Long-term Trends:

1. Accident Fluctuations:
- Notable peak around 2016 across multiple months
- Significant dip in 2020 (likely due to COVID-19 restrictions)
- Recovery trend post-2020 with numbers increasing again

2. Injury and Fatality Patterns:
- Injury numbers generally follow accident patterns
- Fatality rates show more variation and don't always correlate directly with accident numbers
- The ratio of injuries to accidents remains relatively consistent (approximately 1.3 injuries per accident)

Overall Statistics (Averages across months):
- Monthly accidents: ~14,000-17,000
- Monthly injuries: ~17,000-22,000
- Monthly fatalities: ~230-300

Time-based Risk Patterns:

1. High-Risk Periods:
- Highest accident volumes: 15:00-16:00 (9,164 car accidents)
- Morning peak: 7:00-8:00 (4,731 car accidents)
- Evening peak: 17:00-18:00 (9,755 car accidents)
- Lowest accident volumes: Late night/early morning (23:00-0:00 with 2,168 car accidents)

2. Road User Distribution:
- Drivers make up the largest proportion throughout the day:
  * Highest: Early morning (65%+ during 5:00-7:00)
  * Lowest: Night hours (54-56% during 20:00-23:00)
- Passenger involvement shows interesting patterns:
  * Highest: Late night (28-29% during 22:00-23:00)
  * Lowest: Morning rush (14-15% during 6:00-7:00)

3. Vulnerable Road Users:
- Pedestrians:
  * Fairly consistent (4-6% throughout the day)
  * Slightly higher representation during evening hours (5-6%)
- Cyclists:
  * Peak during morning commute (9-10% during 7:00-9:00)
  * Lower during night hours (minimal presence 22:00-0:00)
- Motorcyclists:
  * Higher representation during midday and afternoon (7-9%)
  * Lower during late night/early morning hours (4-5%)

4. Age and Gender Patterns:
- Young adults (18-29):
  * Highest involvement during night hours
  * Male predominance more pronounced during these hours
- Children (0-17):
  * Higher proportion during school transport hours
  * More balanced gender distribution
- Elderly (70+):
  * Higher vulnerability during daylight hours
  * Lower involvement during night hours

5. Vehicle Type Distribution:
- Cars consistently lead in accidents across all hours
- Station wagons maintain second position
- Night-time differences:
  * Lower bicycle involvement
  * Reduced utility vehicle presence
  * Proportionally higher car involvement

Key Safety Implications:
1. Need for enhanced safety measures during peak commute hours
2. Special focus on young male drivers during night hours
3. Protection of vulnerable road users during their peak activity times
4. Different risk profiles between day and night requiring targeted interventions
5. School transport hours requiring specific safety protocols

These patterns suggest the need for time-specific safety strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches to road safety management.

Notable points:
- The seasonal effect is evident with higher incidents during certain months
- There's a clear pattern of reduced accidents during early morning hours (2:00-5:00 AM)
- The recovery pattern post-2020 suggests returning to pre-pandemic levels
- The data shows a consistent relationship between accident times and daily routines (work commutes, school runs, etc.)

Geographic and Temporal Distribution:

1. Urban-Rural Pattern Over 24 Hours:
- Melbourne Urban dominance varies significantly:
  * Highest: Evening period (18:00-19:00) at 69.71%
  * Night hours (20:00-23:00) remains high at 64-66%
  * Early morning (3:00-4:00) shows lowest urban concentration
- Rural Victoria shows inverse pattern:
  * Peaks during early morning hours (24-30%)
  * Lowest during evening rush (15-19%)
  * Maintains 20-22% share during late night hours

2. Time-Based Risk Patterns:
- Peak accident times:
  * Afternoon peak (15:00-16:00): 9,164 car accidents
  * Evening rush (17:00-18:00): 9,755 car accidents
  * Morning peak (7:00-8:00): 4,731 car accidents
- Lowest accident volumes:
  * Late night/early morning (23:00-00:00): 2,168 accidents
  * Pre-dawn hours (2:00-4:00): Similar low volumes

3. Road Surface Conditions:
- Consistent patterns across 24 hours:
  * Dry conditions dominate accident numbers
  * Wet conditions show secondary but significant impact
  * Minimal incidents in extreme conditions (icy/snowy)
- Location categories remain consistent:
  * Intersections (cross, T, Y) show high incident rates
  * Non-intersection accidents form significant portion
  * Dead ends consistently show lower rates

4. Regional Distribution:
- Large Provincial Cities (4-6%):
  * Relatively stable throughout 24 hours
  * Slight increase during business hours
- Small Cities and Towns (combined 5-8%):
  * Higher percentages during daylight hours
  * Reduced representation at night

5. Spatial Clustering:
- Melbourne Metropolitan Area:
  * Dense concentration in CBD and inner suburbs
  * Major arterial routes show consistent patterns
  * Outer suburban areas show time-dependent variation
- Regional Areas:
  * Highway corridors show consistent activity
  * Regional centers have distinct patterns
  * Coastal areas show notable accident clusters

Key Safety Implications:

1. Time-Based Interventions:
- Enhanced enforcement during peak hours
- Special attention to late-night rural driving
- Early morning urban-rural transition period monitoring

2. Geographic Focus:
- Targeted urban strategies for peak hours
- Rural-specific interventions for high-risk periods
- Regional center-specific approaches

3. Infrastructure Priorities:
- Intersection safety improvements
- Wet weather management systems
- Rural road safety enhancements

4. Resource Allocation:
- Time-based emergency response positioning
- Geographic distribution of safety resources
- Weather-dependent intervention strategies

This 24-hour analysis reveals complex patterns requiring multi-faceted approach to road safety, with different strategies needed for different times and locations.
