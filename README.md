Data link: [Victoria road crash data](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/victoria-road-crash-data)


## A brief overview

This comprehensive dashboard analyses road crash data in Victoria from 2012 to 2024, examining key factors contributing to accidents, their geographic distribution, demographic patterns of involved parties, and temporal crash concentrations. 

## Data in a glance

This analysis integrates nine distinct datasets, each capturing different aspects of road incidents: comprehensive accident details, vehicle specifications, personal information of involved parties, event sequences, precise location data, weather conditions at the time of accidents, detailed crash configurations (sub DCA), intersection/node information, and road surface characteristics.

## Reports

Power BI was used to analysis and generate reports about all aspects of road crashes. The reports are organised into four distinct pages shown here:

### Analysis Insights

Analysis of the temporal patterns in the accident data reveals the following key findings:

1. Monthly Variations:
- March had the highest number of total accidents (17,483) and injuries (22,323)
- June had the lowest number of total accidents (13,589) and injuries (17,405)
- November recorded the highest number of fatalities (284)

2. Daily and Hourly Patterns:
- Weekdays show consistent high-risk periods during:
  * Morning peak (8:00-9:00 AM)
  * Afternoon/evening peak (3:00-7:00 PM)
- Weekends display different patterns with:
  * Higher accident concentrations between 11:00 AM-3:00 PM
  * Generally lower early morning incidents

Long-term Trends:

1. Accident Fluctuations:
- Notable peak around 2016 across multiple months
- Significant dip in 2020 (likely due to COVID-19 restrictions)
- Recovery trend post-2020 with numbers increasing again

2. Injury and Fatality Patterns:
- Injury numbers generally follow accident patterns
- Fatality rates show more variation and don't always correlate directly with accident numbers
- The ratio of injuries to accidents remains relatively consistent (approximately 1.3 injuries per accident)

Overall Statistics (Averages across months):
- Monthly accidents: ~14,000-17,000
- Monthly injuries: ~17,000-22,000
- Monthly fatalities: ~230-300

Time-based Risk Patterns:

1. High-Risk Periods:
- Highest accident volumes: 15:00-16:00 (9,164 car accidents)
- Morning peak: 7:00-8:00 (4,731 car accidents)
- Evening peak: 17:00-18:00 (9,755 car accidents)
- Lowest accident volumes: Late night/early morning (23:00-0:00 with 2,168 car accidents)

2. Road User Distribution:
- Drivers make up the largest proportion throughout the day:
  * Highest: Early morning (65%+ during 5:00-7:00)
  * Lowest: Night hours (54-56% during 20:00-23:00)
- Passenger involvement shows interesting patterns:
  * Highest: Late night (28-29% during 22:00-23:00)
  * Lowest: Morning rush (14-15% during 6:00-7:00)

3. Vulnerable Road Users:
- Pedestrians:
  * Fairly consistent (4-6% throughout the day)
  * Slightly higher representation during evening hours (5-6%)
- Cyclists:
  * Peak during morning commute (9-10% during 7:00-9:00)
  * Lower during night hours (minimal presence 22:00-0:00)

Key Safety Implications:
1. Need for enhanced safety measures during peak commute hours
2. Special focus on young male drivers during night hours
3. Protection of vulnerable road users during their peak activity times
4. Different risk profiles between day and night requiring targeted interventions
5. School transport hours requiring specific safety protocols

These patterns suggest the need for time-specific safety strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches to road safety management.

Notable points:
- The seasonal effect is evident with higher incidents during certain months
- There's a clear pattern of reduced accidents during early morning hours (2:00-5:00 AM)
- The recovery pattern post-2020 suggests returning to pre-pandemic levels
- The data shows a consistent relationship between accident times and daily routines (work commutes, school runs, etc.)

Geographic and Temporal Distribution:

1. Urban-Rural Pattern Over 24 Hours:

Accident Volume Pattern:

1. Type of Accidents by Time:

Daytime (6:00-18:00):
- Dominated by vehicle-to-vehicle collisions
- High rear-end collision rates (3,000+ during peak hours)
- Significant cross-traffic incidents at intersections

Evening (18:00-22:00):
- Vehicle collisions remain primary (3,089-4,659)
- Increased fixed object collisions (983-1,068)
- Higher pedestrian incidents (548-741)

Late Night (22:00-4:00):
- Higher proportion of fixed object collisions
- Increased animal-related incidents
- Single vehicle accidents more common

2. High-Risk Behaviors:

Peak Hours:
- Rear-end collisions (highest during 16:00-18:00)
- Intersection violations
- Multiple vehicle incidents

Evening Hours:
- Left/right off carriageway incidents increase
- Out-of-control vehicle incidents rise
- Cross traffic at intersections remains significant

Late Night:
- Fixed object collisions become more prevalent
- Vehicle control issues increase
- Higher proportion of single-vehicle accidents

3. Vulnerable Road Users:

Pedestrians:
- Highest risk during evening peak (15:00-19:00)
- Significant numbers during night (500+ between 20:00-22:00)
- Lower but still concerning numbers in early morning

Animals:
- Increased incidents during dawn/dusk
- Peak during early morning hours
- Higher proportion of total accidents at night

4. Safety Implications:

Time-Based Interventions:
- Enhanced traffic management during 15:00-18:00
- Specific night-time safety measures (22:00-4:00)
- Early morning vigilance (especially for animal incidents)

Risk Management:
- Focused intersection control during peak hours
- Enhanced lighting and signage for night hours
- Special attention to pedestrian areas during evening hours

Geographic Considerations:
- Urban areas need peak hour management
- Rural areas need night-time safety measures
- Suburban areas need balanced approach

This comprehensive analysis suggests that different risk factors dominate at different times, requiring varied safety approaches throughout the day. The transition from peak to off-peak hours shows clear patterns in both the volume and nature of accidents, with distinct characteristics during night hours versus day hours.

The data clearly demonstrates the need for time-specific safety interventions, with particular attention to the distinct challenges presented during peak hours, evening transition periods, and late-night/early morning hours.

## Summary and conclusion

Victoria's road accident analysis reveals distinct temporal patterns with critical peaks during afternoon hours (15:00-18:00) accounting for approximately 14,400 accidents daily, followed by morning rush (8:00-9:00) with 11,146 accidents. The urban-rural distribution shows Melbourne dominating evening accidents (69.71% during 18:00-19:00) while rural areas peak in early mornings (24-30%). Vehicle-to-vehicle collisions, particularly rear-end incidents, dominate peak hours with 3,500+ cases during 17:00-18:00, while fixed object collisions and animal strikes increase significantly during night hours (22:00-04:00). Young adults (18-29) show highest night-time risk, while vulnerable road users follow specific patterns: cyclists peak during morning commute (9-10% of accidents), and pedestrians face highest risk during evening peak (15:00-19:00). Monthly data indicates March as the riskiest month (17,483 accidents, 22,323 injuries) and June as safest (13,589 accidents). Key recommendations include: implementing smart traffic systems and variable speed limits during peak hours, enhancing street lighting and DUI enforcement for night hours (22:00-04:00), establishing time-based emergency response positioning, and developing targeted interventions for specific user groups (school zones, cyclist lanes, pedestrian crossings). The most critical infrastructure priorities should focus on intersection safety improvements, wet weather management systems, and enhanced road marking visibility for night driving.
